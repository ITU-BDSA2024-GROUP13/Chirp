<!-- Show a screenshot of your project board right before hand-in. Briefly describe which tasks are still unresolved, i.e., which features are missing from your applications or which functionality is incomplete.

Briefly describe and illustrate the flow of activities that happen from the new creation of an issue (task description), over development, etc. until a feature is finally merged into the main branch of your repository. -->

Once given a task description, it is formulated into an issue. Once all tasks have been made into issues, they are distributed to one or multiple contributors, depending on the assumed size of the issue.

Once the issue has been started, it is moved from the `Todo` column to the `In Progress` column. 

When the assigned contributors have decided they have completed the issue. They create a pull request and move it into the `In Review` column. This allows others to read and review the pull request. Once there are no issues, then the pull request is accepted and the issue is moved into the `In Prod` column.

The given code which satisfies the original task has now been merged into main.
